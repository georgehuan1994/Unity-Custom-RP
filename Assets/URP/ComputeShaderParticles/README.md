# Compute shader particles
Using Unity's compute shaders to have fun with particles

NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 holds 8 million particles with 40+ FPS, but I reduced them to 1 million for video.

*Small easter egg in file comments*

  I really wanted to participate in GitHub Arctic Code Vault (https://archiveprogram.github.com/), however, I didn't manage to come up with something really cool and useful for the opensource community by the time the snapshot will happen (02/02/2020). So, I am pushing a commit to my most loved and starred (and almost the only) opensource repository to this day to make it included in the snapshot. This stuff produces some beautiful images though has very little sloc. And it is truly an amazing feeling to have something that you have created probably be saved for at least ten times longer than you will live. With love, Nikita.
